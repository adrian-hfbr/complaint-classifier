    "The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database. The database generally updates daily."

    "\n",
    "This analysis focuses on the technical characteristics of the data and the immediate actions required for preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Missing Narratives (64%):** A majority of the dataset lacks a consumer complaint narrative. This is a feature of the data source, where consumers must consent to publication.\n",
    "    * **Action:** For model training, all rows with missing narratives will be dropped.\n",
    "    * **Impact:** This reduces the training set size to ~1.1 million entries and introduces a consent-based selection bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Right-Skewed Narrative Length:** The complaint texts vary significantly in length, with a long tail of extremely lengthy complaints.\n",
    "    * **Action:** The baseline TF-IDF vectorizer is robust to this variance, so no special truncation is needed for this phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of Systemic Biases & Data Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Regulatory Bias:** The database explicitly excludes complaints against depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. The model will therefore be specialized for the products and complaint patterns of **larger financial institutions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Company Response Bias:** The publication process is tied to a company's response or a 15-day waiting period. This means the dataset is a **curated subset** of all filed complaints, not a raw feed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Conclusion:** The final training data represents complaints made against large institutions, which were acknowledged by those institutions, and where the consumer consented to share their story. These limitations are critical for defining the model's scope."
